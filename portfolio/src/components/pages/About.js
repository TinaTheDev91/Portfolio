      <p>
        As you may already know, my name is Tina Croxton and I am a fullstack web developer. But here’s what you may not know:
        
        I graduated from Rutgers University with a Bachelors in Mathematics in 2016. I am currently a Data Conversion Specialist 
        with Paylocity within their Implementation department, where I write SQL queries to migrate sensitive payroll data from one system into theirs. 
        I have a knack for graphic design as well as illustration; they are hobbies that I enjoy in my free time. 
        My desire to create, craft and produce something that can be enjoyed by the public is what pushed me to pursue a career in web development.
        
        As a web developer, I want to create websites that are not only functional and useful, but also unique, engaging and fun to interact with as a user. 
        Now that that’s over, check out my work on the next tab!

    </div>
